# ðŸ“š Introduction to Open Source Information and Technology

## Overview

*This section introduces students to the world of open-source software and intelligence (OSINT), helping them understand how to effectively utilize publicly available information and software in archaeological research.*

## Key Concepts

### Understanding Open Source

Open-source software and intelligence (OSINT)

- Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) is defined as intelligence produced by collecting, evaluating and analyzing publicly available information with the purpose of answering a specific intelligence question. - [sans](https://www.sans.org/)

So what are open-source Tools?

- Open-source tools are software, code libraries, and applications whose source code is publicly available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute, fostering collaboration and flexibility and most of the time they are free.

What are the Benefits of using open-source tools in archaeology?

 - They are free to use and there is lots of documentation and resources available. open source tools also give 
  you the ability to refine your skills which can enhance your ability to stay employed.

Ethical considerations and best practices

- Transparency and security: Maintainers must prioritize code audits and clear risk communication, as vulnerabilities.

- Understanding Inclusive communities: Adopting codes of conduct and making accessible documentation ensures diverse participation and prevents contributor burnout.

- Licensing equity: includings licenses such as an MIT liscense affects whether corporate users share improvements.

- Academic integrity: Publicly funded open source research should mandate open access to data and tools.


### Practical Open Source Applications

There are plenty of open source applications out there but for the sake of domain knowledge I will include only open source applications that could pertain to archaeology.
